# maprdb_python_examples
This repo contains code for using python-bindings with JSON and MapR-DB.  The code in the .py files posted here is used to build a sample application with our partner, [Visual Action](http://www.visualaction.com/).

# Prerequisites

You will need the package [python-bindings](https://github.com/mapr-demos/python-bindings) installed.  You can install this by running ```pip install maprdb```.

The data set used in this application is in this [wellsensors](https://github.com/namato/wellsensors) repo.  You can either use the JSON data posted there, or generate it using Ted Dunning's excellent [log-synth](https://github.com/tdunning/log-synth) software.

# Building the Application

[Follow the instructions in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pbvRTrJNIc) to build the application on your own machine.
